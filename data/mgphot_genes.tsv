0	Vocal Register	vocals	This gene describes the vocal register, or note range, of the lead vocal performance, on a scale from low to high.  For reference, scores in the middle range indicate an average register, which for a male voice is somewhere between A below middle C, and E above middle C, and for a female voice, approximately a fourth higher.
1	Vocal Timbre Thin to Full	vocals	This gene expresses the timbre of the vocal performance from Thin, slight or weak in fundamental or root pitch and markedly wispy (Olivia Newton-John, Margot Timmins) to Full, strong in fundamental pitch and markedly full and resonant (Aretha Franklin, Josh Groban)
2	Vocal Breathiness	vocals	This gene indicates a how Breathy a lead vocal performance is.  Breathiness is the presence of aspiration (breath) in the vocal delivery accompanied by a general "lightness" or "airiness" in the voice. (Ex. Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star, Mariah Carey, Nick Drake)
3	Vocal Smoothness	vocals	This gene indicates a how Smooth a lead vocal performance is.  Smoothness is the absence (or near-absence) of roughness or raspiness in the vocal delivery, yielding some quality of roundness or sweetness. (Ex. Sade, Natalie Cole, James Taylor and Mel Tormé)
4	Vocal Grittiness	vocals	This gene indicates a how Gritty a lead vocal performance is.  Grittiness is the presence of roughness or raspiness in the vocal delivery, yielding some quality of harshness or "dirtiness." (Ex. Tom Waits, Joe Cocker, Janis Joplin)
5	Vocal Nasality	vocals	This gene indicates a how Nasal a lead vocal performance is.  Nasality is the presence of a pinched or "plugged-up" quality in the vocal delivery – particularly noticeable in the "nasal" consonants (n, m, d). (Ex. Bob Dylan, Joe Walsh, Reba McEntire)
6	Vocal Accompaniment	vocals	This gene indicates the level of dominance of Accompaniment vocals in a track and includes any vocal activity that is not in a lead role.
7	Minor / Major Key Tonality	harmony	This gene indicates the harmonic tonality on a scale of minor to major.  The lowest scores indicate a minor tonality throughout, the highest scores indicate a major tonality throughout, and scores in the middle indicate ambiguity in tonality, either because both are present in the song, or because the music doesn't fall clearly in either category.
8	Harmonic Sophistication	harmony	This gene captures the level of complexity present in a track’s harmony. Annotators perform a harmonic analysis to determine what chords are present in the song, then apply a pre-determined rubric to assign a score on our scale. The lowest score indicates no more than a tonic, subdominant and dominant chord (ie, I, IV, V). Moving up the scale, we include additional diatonic chords (e.g. ii, iii, vi), then secondary dominant chords, then other non-diatonic chords, on up to extreme chromaticism.
9	Tempo	rhythm	This gene describes the basic tempo (i.e. beats per minute) of the song.  While this essentially describes how slow or fast a song is, it is important to note that other factors besides tempo affect how slow or fast a song feels.  For example, more sparse subdivisions in the drums and percussion, or a "cut time" feel can make a song feel slower than the tempo might suggest.
10	Cut Time Feel	rhythm	This gene indicates the presence and degree of dominance of a "cut time" rhythmic feel, in which four beat measures are felt in a half time, ie, a "two" feel, usually due to the bass instrument playing only on beats 1 and 3.
11	Triple Meter	rhythm	This gene indicates the presence and degree of dominance of a triple meter, ie, 3 beat groupings, the most common of which is 3/4.
12	Compound Meter	rhythm	This gene indicates the presence and degree of dominance of a compound meter, most commonly either 6/8 or 12/8.  This meter is distinctive for its combination of a triple meter with a duple meter (ie, 2 or 4).  For instance, 12/8 is counted in 4 beat groupings, but each of the four beats is subdivided into 3.  6/8 is counted in 2 beat groupings, with each beat subdivided into 3.
13	Odd Meter	rhythm	This gene indicates the presence and degree of dominance of an "odd" meter.  The most common odd meters are groups of 5 or 7, but other more complex beat groupings are possible.
14	Swing Feel	rhythm	This gene indicates the amount of swing feel in the song.  By "swing feel" we mean an uneven 8th note rhythmic feel common in many genres, especially jazz, in which the first 8th note is slightly longer in duration than the second.
15	Shuffle Feel	rhythm	This gene indicates the amount of shuffle feel in the song.  By "shuffle feel" we mean an uneven 8th note rhythmic feel, similar to swing, but with a more insistent articulation of each 8th note, common in many genres, especially blues and country music.
16	Syncopation Low to High	rhythm	This gene indicates the relative level of syncopation in the song.  By "Syncopation", we mean the use of rhythmic tension against the strong beats of the measure – by accentuating rhythmic anticipations or by obscuring the meter with deliberate cross-rhythms. Syncopation can appear in any instrument, but the most salient instruments are the drums and percussion, where rhythm is most directly articulated.
17	Backbeat	rhythm	This gene indicates the presence and degree of dominance of a backbeat rhythm in the song - strong emphasis on beats 2 and 4 would make this score higher.
18	Danceability	rhythm	This gene indicates the relative "danceability" of the song.  Songs with the lowest scores are difficult or impossible to dance to, and songs with the highest scores are specifically made for dancing.
19	Drum Set	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of a drum set in the instrumentation of the song.
20	Drum Aggressiveness	instrumentation	This gene indicates the aggressiveness level of the drum set performance, ranging from extremely light (e.g. using brushes with a light touch) to the extreme aggression common in hard rock and metal genres.
21	Synthetic Drums	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence and degree of dominance of synthetic drums in the song.  Synthetic drum sounds can be triggered manually with the use of MIDI drum pads, or they can be programmed with a drum machine or music production software. Note: the Synthetic Drums gene is a subset of the Drum Set gene, which means in order for the Synthetic Drums to be present, the Drum Set gene music also be present.
22	Percussion	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of percussion in the instrumentation of the song, excluding drum set, which is described by a separate gene.
23	Electric Guitar	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of electric guitar(s) in the instrumentation of the song.
24	Electric Guitar Distortion	instrumentation	This gene indicates the overall degree and impact of guitar distortion in the song.  The lowest scores indicate very clean (unmodified) guitar tones, while very high scores indicate extremely "dirty" tones, common in extreme forms of metal.
25	Acoustic Guitar	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of acoustic guitar(s) in the instrumentation of the song.
26	String Ensemble	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of a string ensemble in the instrumentation of the song.  This can include small or large ensembles, for example, two violins all the way to a large orchestra
27	Horn Ensemble	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of a horn ensemble in the instrumentation of the song.  This can include small or large ensembles, for examples, two trumpets all the way to large concert band.
28	Piano	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of a piano in the instrumentation of the song.
29	Organ	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of an organ in the instrumentation of the song.
30	Rhodes	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of a Fender Rhodes or other electric piano in the instrumentation of the song.
31	Synthesizer	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of one or more synthesizers in the instrumentation of the song, excluding synthesized sounds meant to closely mimic other types of instruments such as horns, flutes, electric pianos, strings etc...
32	Synth Timbre	instrumentation	This gene describes the timbres of syntheizers, on a scale from "ambient" (e.g. atmospheric synth pads) to more industrial or robotic synth timbres common in electronic and dance genres such as Techno.
33	Bass Guitar	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of a bass guitar in the instrumentation of the song.
34	Reed Instrument	instrumentation	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of reed instrument in the instrumentation of the song.  The most common example is the saxophone, but can include other single reed instruments such as clarinet, as well as double reed instruments such as the oboe, and the english horn.
35	Angry Lyrics	lyrics	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of angry lyrics in the song.
36	Sad Lyrics	lyrics	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of sad lyrics in the song.
37	Happy/Joyful Lyrics	lyrics	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of happy or joyful lyrics in the song.
38	Humorous Lyrics	lyrics	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of funny or humorous lyrics in the song.
39	Love/Romance Lyrics	lyrics	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of romantic lyrics, or lyrics about love in the song.
40	Social/Political Lyrics	lyrics	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of lyrics pertaining to social or political issues in the song.
41	Abstract Lyrics	lyrics	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of abstract or whimsical lyrics in the song.
42	Explicit Lyrics	lyrics	This gene measures the excpicitness of lyrics, based on a rubric created internally to satisfy listener, advertiser and brand safety concerns.  We use an established rubric to evaluate the presence of certain explicit words, as well as thematic material, including descriptions of sex or violence, and other mature subject matter.
43	Live Recording	sonority	This gene indicates if the song was recorded in a recording studio or at a live performance.
44	Audio Production	sonority	This gene evaluates the quality and sophistication of the audio Production. A middling score is indicative of a "typical" commercial Pop production – clean, well executed, yet unexceptional. Scores below the mid range indicate the recording production falls below "standard" expectations – perhaps due to poor fidelity or mixing. The lowest scores indicate a very poor quality recording (e.g. filled with hiss or pops, overpowering audience or external noises). Scores above the mid range indicate that the recording production exceeds "standard" expectations; while the highest scores are indicative of a real production masterpiece.
45	Aural Intensity	sonority	This gene measures the overall softness or loudness of a song, from extremely quiet and unobtrusive to extemely loud, harsh, and grating.
46	Acoustic Sonority	sonority	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of acoustic sonorities in the song, such as acoustic pianos and guitars, human voices, and orchestral instruments.
47	Electric Sonority	sonority	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of electric instruments in the song, such as electric guitars, electric bass, and electro-mechanical and amplified instruments such as electric organs and electric pianos.
48	Synthetic Sonority	sonority	This gene indicates the presence, and degree of dominance, of synthetic instruments such as synthesizers, synthetic drums, and synthetic strings.
49	Focus on Lead Vocal	composition	This gene indicates how compositionally dominant the lead vocals are to the overall experience of a track.  Most tracks containing vocals will deserve a high score here as lead vocals are typically a songs main focus.

53	Focus on Rhythmic Groove	composition	This gene indicates how compositionally dominant the rhythmic feel or "groove" is to the overall experience of a track.  
54	Focus on Musical Arrangements	composition	This gene indicates how compositionally dominant the arrangement is to the overall experience of a track.  This includes both the number of instruments and the quality and novelty of the part-writing and orchestration involved.
55	Focus on Form	composition	This gene indicates how compositionally dominant the form is to the overall experience of a track.  A more complex and/or non-traditional form will deserve a higher score while a common Verse/Chorus/Bridge form will land somewhere in the middle.
56	Focus on Riffs	composition	This gene indicates how compositionally dominant 'Riffs' are to the overall experience of a track.  Riffs are short repeated instrumental melodic phrases.  Examples include The Ocean by Led Zeppelin or the bassline to Rapper's Delight by Sugarhill Gang.
57	Focus on Performance	composition	This gene indicates how compositionally dominant instrumental performance is to the overall experience of a track.  Most instrumental Jazz and Classical music will score highly here as the focus in these genres is typically on the abilities of the instrumentalists.
